I made this because I was annoyed with having to click and drag to copy a branch name that has slashes in it in pull requests.

To add to Chrome:

1. Clone copy-branch-name repository
2. Go to Tools -> Extensions in Chrome
3. Check "Developer mode"
4. Click "Load unpacked extension"
5. Add copy-branch-name directory
